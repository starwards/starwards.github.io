In our last stop on our journey for our [first space fighter](/2021-04-24-fighter-art-2), we have completed the final concept art for the space fighter and were ready to move into 3D modeling.

Translating the concept art into a 3D model took us some time, as we needed to change some geometries in order for them to make sense in 3D view and to make sure all the details that were important for us will be represented in the model itself.

After hard work and about 40 revisions, the job was done. A new space fighter was born into this world:

We chose the name Dragonfly due to the ability of the fighter to maneuver in all directions. The code SF stands for “Space Fighter”. In our perception, space fighters will be treated more closely to fighter jets than a ship, meaning they will not have a unique call sign (the pilot will have one).
