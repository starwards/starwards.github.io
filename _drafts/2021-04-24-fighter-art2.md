Two weeks ago, we told you about our first steps with designing our [ideal space fighter](/2021-04-10-fighter-art-1), which ended with a collection of concept art but without a final design. We understood that we would need to properly define our needs to the artists in order to get a design that will fit what we are thinking about.

Our first attempt did not work so well. We did explain that the fighter needs to bulky and armored from one side (more of an [A-10]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II), less of a [F15]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle)), but still to have excellent maneuverability, that will make sense in space. We thought that unlike the larger ships that will need to rely on [“flip and burn”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL6UlySo3-M) the small and swift fighter would have the advantage of having burners for all directions, allowing it to perform maneuvers that larger ships can only dream on.

However, the first sketch was still looking too much like an atmospheric jet fighter:
