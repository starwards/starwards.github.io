It's been 867 days since our last blog post. The last time we posted was June 2022—we'd just implemented radar damage and shown off some simple AI commands.

Then the blog went silent. Not because the project stopped (it didn't), but because we were heads-down building and forgot to document along the way. Classic mistake.

So here we are in November 2024, with two and a half years of work to catch up on.

## What We've Been Building

Since June 2022, we've implemented most of the systems we'd only designed on paper:

- Complete energy and heat management (the "engineering milestone" we promised back in 2021)
- Missiles with homing guidance and proximity detonation (completing the three engagement circles)
- Full sectional armor system (the Battletech-inspired design from April 2021, now actually working)
- Bot AI with tactical orders (evolved from that spiral bug we showed in June 2022)
- Warp drives, waypoints, and docking
- Comprehensive documentation and testing infrastructure
- We also removed the 3D rendering code (more on that later)

We also shifted focus in March 2024 to concentrate on reaching a LARP-playable product rather than continuing to explore every possible feature. That meant making hard choices about what to build, what to defer, and what to cut.

## Why We Went Silent

Honest answer: we got focused on building and didn't make time to write about it.

There was also some uncertainty about how to communicate what we were doing. When you're focusing efforts and cutting scope, it can feel like admitting failure. When you're deleting code you previously showed off (like the 3D rendering), it's uncomfortable to explain.

But that's exactly why we should have kept writing—to work through those decisions in public and document the reasoning.

We didn't. We stayed quiet. That was a mistake.

## What's Coming

Over the next few months, we're going to write a series of posts covering everything that happened since June 2022. Each post will focus on one system or decision:

- Why we removed 3D rendering (and why that was the right call)
- The complete energy, heat, and coolant systems
- Missiles, torpedoes, and explosion physics
- Sectional armor implementation (finally done right)
- Bot AI and autopilot systems
- Navigation: warp, waypoints, and docking
- Combat refinements and targeting
- Documentation and testing infrastructure
- The development approach and what we learned
- Where we're heading in 2025

These won't be announcement posts. We're going to show the work, explain the decisions, and be honest about what worked and what didn't.

## Where We Are Now

As of November 2024, Starwards has the core systems needed for a LARP bridge simulator. Energy management, combat, navigation, damage—it's all there and it works.

Is it complete? No. There are still features on the roadmap: corvette-class ships, advanced damage reports, cyber warfare, and more. But the foundation is solid.

More importantly, we're back to writing about it. We're going to keep this blog active going forward, documenting progress as we make it rather than going silent for years at a time.

## What's Next

The first post in the series will be about the 3D rendering decision. We spent months building 3D in 2021, showed it off in the blog, then deleted it all in 2024. That probably seems strange, so we're going to explain exactly why we did it and what we learned about focus and priorities.

See you in a week or two.

(And yes, the radar damage you read about in June 2022 still works. We kept the good stuff.)
