So here we are.

It's been 867 days since our last blog post. Not that we're counting. (Okay, we're definitely counting.)

The last time we posted, it was June 2022. We'd just implemented radar damage, shown off some simple AI commands, and declared Starwards open-source. Then... silence. Complete radio silence for two and a half years.

You'd be forgiven for thinking the project died. We wouldn't blame you. That's usually what happens when a devlog goes dark for that long.

But here's the thing: we didn't stop working. Not even close.

## What Happened?

In March 2024, something significant happened. We looked at the codebase we'd built from 2021-2022 and made a hard decision: start fresh. Not abandon the project—start fresh. There's a difference.

We'd learned so much from building the prototype. We'd learned even more from our EmptyEpsilon fork experience (remember that saga from early 2021?). And we realized we had the knowledge to build something better, cleaner, more maintainable.

So we did. We rewrote Starwards from the ground up.

And in the process of rebuilding the foundation, we also built:
- A complete energy and heat management system
- Missiles with homing guidance and proximity detonation
- Full sectional armor implementation (the one we designed back in 2021)
- A sophisticated bot AI that can execute tactical orders
- Warp drives, waypoints, and docking systems
- Comprehensive documentation (because we finally learned that lesson)
- A testing infrastructure that actually works
- ...and we removed all the 3D rendering code

Wait, what was that last one?

Yeah. We spent months building 3D rendering in 2021, showed it off in the blog, and then in 2024 we deleted it all. Every line. And we're going to tell you exactly why, because that decision says a lot about what we've learned.

## Why We Went Silent

Here's the honest answer: we got focused on building instead of documenting.

After the rewrite started in March 2024, we were in heads-down mode. Systems were coming together fast. We were implementing features we'd only designed on paper years ago. Energy systems, missiles, armor—all the engineering content we'd promised back in our "second milestone" post from 2021.

And we made a classic mistake: we told ourselves we'd write about it later. After this next feature. After we fixed this bug. After we got to a good stopping point.

Spoiler alert: there's never a good stopping point.

But there's another reason, and it's more uncomfortable to admit: we weren't sure how to write about a rewrite.

How do you tell people "hey, remember all that code we showed you? We deleted it and started over"? How do you explain that without it sounding like the project is in trouble, or we wasted two years, or we don't know what we're doing?

The answer, we eventually realized, is: you just tell the truth. You explain the decision, show the reasoning, and trust your readers to understand that sometimes you need to rebuild the foundation.

So that's what we're going to do.

## What's Coming

Over the next few months, we're going to write a series of posts catching you up on everything that happened since June 2022. Everything.

We're talking about:
- The decision to remove 3D rendering and focus on depth over spectacle
- How we implemented the complete engineering system with energy, heat, and coolant
- Missiles that home, explode, and actually complete our "engagement circles" vision
- The sectional armor system we designed in 2021, now fully implemented and tested
- Bot AI that evolved from "spiral bug" to sophisticated tactical orders
- Warp drives that finally let us think bigger than a single combat zone
- The developer experience revolution that made Starwards actually welcoming to contributors
- Why we rewrote everything and what we learned
- Where we're heading in 2025

Each post will dive deep into one piece of the puzzle. We're not doing surface-level "we added this feature" announcements. We're doing what we've always done: showing the journey, explaining the decisions, sharing the struggles, and being honest about what worked and what didn't.

## A Promise (A Realistic One)

We're not going to promise daily updates or weekly posts. We learned that lesson. What we can promise is:
- One substantial post every 1-2 weeks
- Real depth, not just announcements
- Honesty about the journey
- The same transparent, process-focused approach we've always taken

And here's the other promise: we're not going silent again. Even when the catch-up series is done, we're committed to keeping this devlog alive. Because we've realized something over these 867 days: the documentation matters. The story matters. Not just for you, but for us too.

Writing forces us to think clearly about our decisions. It creates a record we can look back on. It builds community. And it holds us accountable.

So we're back. For real this time.

## Where We Are Now

As of November 2025, Starwards is more complete than it's ever been. The rewrite worked. The systems we promised years ago are implemented. The game is playable, testable, and actually fun.

Is it done? Of course not. We still have the roadmap items we'll talk about in the final catch-up post. Corvette-class ships. Advanced cyber warfare. Multiple bridges. All the ambitious stuff.

But for the first time, we have a foundation we're confident in. A codebase we're proud of. A system architecture that can grow.

And most importantly: we have stories to tell.

Starting next week, we're going to tell them.

## What's Next

The first post in the catch-up series will tackle the hardest decision we made: removing 3D rendering. Six months of work, deleted in a single PR. It was painful, it was necessary, and it taught us something important about focus and productivity.

We're calling it "Letting Go of 3D: A Focus Decision."

See you in a week or two.

(And yes, the radar damage you read about in June 2022 still works. We kept the good stuff.)
