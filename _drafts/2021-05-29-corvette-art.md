While we are still working on our [second milestone]({% link _posts/2021-03-27-2nd-milestone.md %}), we decided to keep our parrlel work on the art design for the game and start working on our first model of a coverrete class ship. This is an important step - as much as we love our space fighter design, we are aiming to create a bridge simulator and therefore we will need larger ships with larger crew. 

We agreed that a [coverrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvette) will be the most fitting class of ship to design.
