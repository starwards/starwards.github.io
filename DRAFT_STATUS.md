# Blog Draft Status

## What I Fixed

### 1. Voice Documentation (WRITING_STYLE_ANALYSIS.md)
Added a critical section called "Avoid AI Social Media Content Patterns" that explicitly calls out:
- No dramatic pacing with artificial tension
- No extracting drama from mundane decisions
- No breaking rhythm with short paragraphs for effect
- No marketing speak formulas
- No artificial cliffhanger transitions

This should prevent future AI writing from having that slick, mechanical pacing.

### 2. Opening Post (were-back.md)
**Before:** Full of dramatic tension, "liberating and terrifying" language, false rewrite narrative
**After:**
- Straightforward admission of silence
- Removed false "March 2024 rewrite" story
- Changed to "shifted focus to reach LARP-playable product"
- Cut the performative vulnerability
- More matter-of-fact about what happened and why

### 3. 3D Removal Post (01-letting-go-of-3d.md)
**Added:**
- Unity POC context (Colyseus polyglot capability)
- Explanation that 3D will return as separate Unity client
- This is deferral, not abandonment
- Asset pipeline cost (not just code maintenance)

**Removed:**
- Dramatic opening ("In March 2024, we made a decision that was both liberating and terrifying")
- "And then we merged it." style one-liners
- Overly dramatic narration

### 4. Created BLOG_QUESTIONS.md
Comprehensive list of questions I need answers to for next iteration, organized by topic:
- Timeline clarifications (what actually happened in March 2024?)
- Technical system implementation dates
- Development history
- Current state assessment
- Fact-checking specific claims

## What Still Needs Major Work

### Posts with Voice Issues (need de-dramatization)

All the technical posts (02-10) still have the AI social media voice problems:
- Too many "Here's where it gets interesting..." transitions
- Short one-line paragraphs for dramatic effect
- "And that's when we realized..." formula writing
- Artificial tension building

These need to be rewritten in a more straightforward, matter-of-fact tone.

### Posts with Factual Issues

**Post 9 (The Rewrite)** - This entire post is based on a false premise. Options:
1. Delete it entirely
2. Massively rewrite it as "The Focus Shift" or "Reaching for Playable"
3. Merge its content into other posts

Need your guidance on what actually happened to write this accurately.

**All technical posts (02-08)** - Need to verify:
- When systems were actually implemented
- What was in 2021-2022 vs. 2024
- Specific PR numbers and dates
- Whether features actually work as described

## What I Need From You

### Priority 1: Answer BLOG_QUESTIONS.md
This will let me fix factual errors and understand what actually happened.

### Priority 2: Voice Guidance
After I rewrite with correct facts, I'll need you to check if the voice is closer to yours. I can iterate on this.

### Priority 3: Content Decisions
- Should I delete Post 9 entirely or rewrite it?
- Are there posts in the series you don't want?
- Are there topics missing from the series?

## Remaining Work

1. **Rewrite all technical posts (02-08)** with:
   - Correct voice (matter-of-fact, not dramatic)
   - Verified facts from your answers
   - Proper context and timeline

2. **Fix or delete Post 9** based on your guidance

3. **Verify Post 10** (roadmap/future) is accurate to your thinking

4. **Add placeholder notes** for visuals ("[SCREENSHOT: armor widget here]")

5. **Final voice pass** - you review and I iterate until it sounds like you

## Files Modified
- `WRITING_STYLE_ANALYSIS.md` - Added "what not to do" section
- `_drafts/were-back.md` - Fixed voice and removed false rewrite narrative
- `_drafts/01-letting-go-of-3d.md` - Added Unity POC context, fixed voice
- `BLOG_QUESTIONS.md` - New file with questions for you
- `DRAFT_STATUS.md` - This file

## Files Still Needing Work
- `_drafts/02-engineering-complete.md` - Voice issues
- `_drafts/03-missiles-torpedoes-explosions.md` - Voice issues
- `_drafts/04-armor-reborn.md` - Voice issues
- `_drafts/05-bots-ai-commanders.md` - Voice issues
- `_drafts/06-navigation-warp-waypoints-docking.md` - Voice issues
- `_drafts/07-combat-refinements.md` - Voice issues
- `_drafts/08-developer-experience-revolution.md` - Voice issues
- `_drafts/09-the-rewrite.md` - Factually wrong, needs major revision or deletion
- `_drafts/10-state-of-starwards-2025.md` - Needs verification

## Next Steps

Please review:
1. Are the voice fixes in `were-back.md` and `01-letting-go-of-3d.md` closer to what you want?
2. Can you answer the questions in `BLOG_QUESTIONS.md`?
3. Should I proceed with rewriting posts 02-10, or do you want to handle these yourself?
