While we are still working on our [second milestone]({% link _posts/2021-03-27-2nd-milestone.md %}), we decided to keep our parallel work on the art design for the game and start working on our first model of a corvette class ship. This is an important step - as much as we love our space fighter design, we aim to create a bridge simulator, and therefore we will need larger ships operated by a crew. 

We agreed that our first warship would be a [corvette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvette) class, as it is the smallest class of warships. However, unlike the space fighter, we are a bit less sure how we want our first corvette to look. We do feel that the [Rocinante](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/expanse/images/3/37/Mcrncorvetteclassconceptart.png/revision/latest?cb=20180720194228) from the Expanse is an excellent example for a realistic corvette in space, so we decided to try and use it as our reference.

We started to work with our concept artists for general ideas and came with the initial concepts below.

Although none of them hit the spot, it helped us better understand what we are looking for, and now we are ready to refine our ideas and move to another round of concept art.
