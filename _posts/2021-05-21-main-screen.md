Remember our [first post in this blog]({% link _posts/2021-01-14-welcome.md %}), where we showed an image of our main screen?

As we update our graphic design, we've decided it was time to update the main screen as well. Now it looks like this:

![Main Screen1](/assets/img/main screen1 2021-05-22.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And when a game is running, it looks like this:
![Main Screen2](/assets/img/main screen2 2021-05-22.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We're also experimenting with new radar looks, but there's nothing yet worth showing.
