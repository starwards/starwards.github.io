Implementing damage effects on the radar. When the radar is damaged, it's range starts to fluctuate between its regular range and a limited range (3,000-1,500 in the video): The more damage is done to the radar, the more time is spent in limited radar range.

Of course, if another ship with decent radar range is nearby and shares her radar with the damaged ship, it might not make much  difference.
 
See the video of how it feels to be a lone fighter with damaged radar:
