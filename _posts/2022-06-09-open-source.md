(we apologize for not updating this blog)

Today we've open-sourced the project and made it public with the hope of recruiting help from the community. 

It still shows signs of being a closed project (not enough automated tests, missing documentation, missing communication of principles and vision, etc.). However, we are eager to fix things to make it more welcoming to newcomers and would appreciate your help and feedback.
