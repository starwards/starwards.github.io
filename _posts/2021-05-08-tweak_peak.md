First look at our preliminary UI for creating malfunctions!

As soon as the GM is selecting a ship, the menu from the left is popping up, and the GM can decide for which component he wants to create a malfunction. At the moment, we can disable each one of the thrusters (the fighter has 6), but we are planning to add all the different components of the ship (weapon, sensors, navigation, etc).

As mentioned, this is a preliminary UI, and we will need to rework it to easily support more components and multiple types of malfunctions for each component.
