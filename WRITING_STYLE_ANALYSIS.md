# Starwards Blog - Writing Style Analysis

## Overview

The Starwards blog employs a **transparent, conversational devlog style** that combines technical game development insights with accessible storytelling. The writing balances hard sci-fi rigor with pragmatic LARP game design, creating an authentic behind-the-scenes narrative.

---

## Voice & Tone

### Primary Voice: Collective "We"
- Default perspective is first-person plural ("we decided", "we discussed")
- Represents the team as a unified entity
- Creates inclusive, collaborative atmosphere
- Occasional first-person singular when individual authors are credited (e.g., Amir's "go to" command post)

### Tone Characteristics:
1. **Honest & Self-Aware**
   - Admits mistakes: "We should have moved forward at an earlier stage"
   - Acknowledges limitations: "it's still showing signs of being a closed project"
   - Shares failures alongside successes

2. **Conversational & Approachable**
   - Uses casual interjections: "Easy peasy!", "Fork it", "Dead simple, right?"
   - Rhetorical questions engage readers
   - Informal language: "very trickey" [sic], "fiesty jouster"

3. **Self-Deprecating Humor**
   - "At this point I've realized that it was going to take a while... So, I made myself a cup of coffee and sat down to write about it in this blog. Yes. I procrastinate."
   - "We also established who is the better pilot."

4. **Reflective & Transparent**
   - Shows decision-making process, not just results
   - Discusses trade-offs openly
   - Reveals doubt and uncertainty: "we weren't sure what that next phase should be"

---

## Structure & Organization

### Typical Post Architecture:

1. **Context-Setting Opening**
   - Establishes background or current situation
   - Often references previous posts or decisions
   - Example: "After laying the technical foundations, the project was stuck..."

2. **Problem/Dilemma Presentation**
   - Clear articulation of challenges
   - Multiple perspectives considered
   - Uses headers to organize thoughts

3. **Analysis & Exploration**
   - Methodical examination of options
   - External references (videos, articles, other games)
   - Numbered lists for criteria or considerations

4. **Resolution/Decision**
   - Explicit "The Decision" sections common
   - Clear statement of chosen path
   - Justification provided

5. **Optional Action Items**
   - Some posts end with concrete next steps
   - Bullet-pointed tasks
   - Example: "write problems 'Bank' per system"

### Structural Devices:
- **Heavy use of H2/H3 headers** for navigation
- **Blockquotes** for definitions and external content
- **Embedded media** (videos, images) integrated naturally into narrative
- **Lists** (numbered and bulleted) for organization
- **Italics** for emphasis, not bold (generally)

---

## Content Patterns

### 1. Design Diary Format
Posts document the development journey chronologically, showing:
- Initial state → problem identification → solution exploration → implementation → results
- Learning moments and iterations
- Evolution of thinking over time

### 2. Problem-Solution Narratives
Most posts follow this arc:
- "What we wanted to achieve"
- "Why it was difficult"
- "How we approached it"
- "What we learned"

### 3. Philosophical Justification
Strong emphasis on **internal consistency** and **justification**:
- "As we strive to create a world with coherent internal reasoning, justification is a big deal for us"
- Willing to compromise strict realism for gameplay: "we need firstly to promote features that we believe will contribute to the LARP experience"
- Hard sci-fi aspirations balanced with practical LARP needs

### 4. Educational Content
Posts teach while documenting:
- Explains concepts for non-experts (TPK, Hit Points, engagement ranges)
- Links to external resources (Wikipedia, YouTube)
- Contextualizes technical decisions

---

## Language Characteristics

### Sentence Structure:
- **Mix of short and long sentences**
- Short for impact: "Easy peasy!"
- Long for complex explanation with embedded clauses
- Compound sentences with semicolons and em-dashes

### Vocabulary:
- **Technical but accessible**: Uses game dev/LARP jargon but explains when necessary
- **Domain-specific terms**: Structure Regions (SR), Game Master (GM), CIWS, railgun
- **Casual interjections**: "pretty similar", "pretty dull", "Dead simple, right?"
- **Sci-fi terminology**: fighters, torpedos, sensors, damage reports

### Stylistic Quirks:
1. **Pop Culture References**
   - "Guns. Lots of Guns" (Matrix)
   - References to The Expanse, Battletech, Thorium
   - YouTube video embeds as supporting arguments

2. **Parenthetical Asides**
   - Frequent use of parentheses for definitions, clarifications, examples
   - "(loose definition: ...)", "(we call it 'bot')", "(not to mention...)"

3. **Emphasis Through Formatting**
   - *Italics* for emphasis: "huge", "that", "never"
   - ALL CAPS rarely used
   - Bold text minimal

4. **Technical Humor**
   - "Fork it" (software pun)
   - Playful naming: "Jouster bot", "fiesty jouster"

## Narrative Techniques

### 1. Real-Time Development Narrative
Some posts capture the moment of development:
- "I open the GM screen... and then the ship begins turning... and I am in developer heaven: success on first try! I love it when that happens. So rare. But wait - why is the ship not stopping?"
- Shows bugs, frustration, problem-solving in real-time
- Creates drama and relatability

### 2. Retrospective Analysis
Other posts look back reflectively:
- "After months of work, we looked back..."
- "After giving it a deep thought..."
- Shows maturity and learning

### 3. Decision Documentation
Explicit documentation of why choices were made:
- Lists criteria before decisions
- Weighs pros and cons openly
- Records rejected alternatives

### 4. Journey Narrative
The Epsilon Saga post exemplifies long-form storytelling:
- Chapter-like structure with evocative headers: "First Contact", "The Chasm", "The Fork"
- Arc from beginning to end
- Emotional journey alongside technical journey
